    "1) Tempo: For the typical transition, you want to stay within 5 bpm of the current song. If the tempo of the next song is very different from the current, you are forced to speed up/slow down the current song which can be noticable to people.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Key: Matching the key, or finding a song with a similar key will help your transition sound much cleaner. While most people won't notice or care, selecting the right key will take a good transition to amazing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Energy: You don't want to transition from high energy to low energy, or vice-versa. A change in energy is fine but an abrupt switch up will throw people off\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Genre: Songs can differ greatly within genres, but staying within one genre or switching between similar genres will help with finding songs that go well together. Even if your tempo and key match, a transition from Techno to Classical could be a little questionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Popularity: Sometimes popularity is all you need. If people like a song, they probably won't even care how good your mix is."

    "#### 1) I would probably split up our categories into:\n",
    "- closeness to curent song\n",
    "\n",
    "- the rating of category\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this is because for a category like tempo, we want to keep the bpm similar to the current song, but popularity should always try to be maximized, and shouldn't depend on the rating of the current song.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) After splitting them up, here is how I rank them in importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Closeness:**\n",
    "1) Tempo: We want similar speed, we should probably just filter tempo out right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Key: While not noticed by most people, a mix that is in key will always sound better compared to one that isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Energy: For simple, smooth transitions, we would like to keep the energy around the same. But we also don't want to limit ourselves if there is an opportunity to bump up the energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rating:**\n",
    "1) Popularity: If a song is popular, there is a higher chance people will like it\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Danceability: When DJing, you probably are looking for fun, danceable songs. But sometimes danceability comes with popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Liveness: This data set describes liveness as \"likelihood of a track being performed live\". This doesn't matter as much to us compared to if a band were deciding what song to play live. But it does relate to our question of \"what songs do people want to hear?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Genre**\n",
    "For now, I am not going to mess with genre. We'll still leave it in our dataframe, but it can just be a category the user can consider when using the program. Also I did notice afterwards, that \"genre\" in the context of this dataset describes the genre of the playlist the song was taken from, so it may not even be very accurate."
